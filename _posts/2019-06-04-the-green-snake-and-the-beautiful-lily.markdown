This morning I’m returning to the world of esoteric culture, the Theosophical Society, the world of Madame Blavatsky, and the realm of exploring hidden knowledge. In particular, I want to think about Rudolf Steiner, a key figure in this world. Steiner, an Austrian born in 1861, is perhaps best known today for his experimental educational curriculum, used in Steiner Schools. These schools emphasize holistic, spiritual education, punctuated by exercise, movement, and creativity, aiming to foster harmony in society.

Steiner was a polymath who traversed diverse intellectual landscapes: philosophy, literature, and German idealism. He was deeply influenced by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the archetypal German scholar, poet, scientist, and author of *Faust*. Steiner spent much of his early life studying and cataloguing Goethe’s works. However, his life took a radical turn in his forties when he became involved in the Theosophical Society and esoteric culture. This shift was catalyzed by an essay he wrote on Goethe’s fairy tale *The Green Snake and the Beautiful Lily*. This essay, interpreting the symbology within the story, marked the beginning of Steiner’s engagement with esoteric thought.

### The Fairy Tale: *The Green Snake and the Beautiful Lily*

Goethe’s 1795 fairy tale, which I’ve adapted into a simplified version below, is rich with symbolic meaning:

Once upon a time, a Ferryman was awoken by two will-o’-wisps seeking passage across the Great River. The Ferryman agreed but refused their gold as payment, fearing it would cause a tempest if dropped into the river. Instead, he demanded three cabbages, three artichokes, and three onions as payment. The will-o’-wisps agreed and left, scattering their gold on the riverbank.

The gold awakened a green Snake deep in a cleft of rock. Delighted, the Snake swallowed the gold, which melted within her, emanating a brilliant light. This newfound illumination allowed her to explore the depths of the earth, where she discovered a grand Temple dedicated to wisdom, appearance, and strength.

Meanwhile, a sad Prince, who loved the Beautiful Lily but believed he could never be with her, returned to the Ferryman with the will-o’-wisps' payment. He lamented his loneliness and resolved to see Lily, even if it meant his death. Reaching the garden, he approached Lily but collapsed and died before reaching her. 

Moved by compassion, the Snake emerged and placed Lily’s and the Prince’s hands on her glowing body, reviving the Prince. At that moment, the ground shook, and the Temple rose from the earth. The Snake, realizing the true unifying force was love, stretched herself across the river to form a bridge, uniting the lands of the senses and the spirit. The Prince and Lily were married, and the bridge became a passage for countless travelers. The Temple became the most frequented place on earth.

### The Symbolism of the Fairy Tale

Goethe’s story, written during the French Revolution, reflects his contemplation of freedom, reason, and human wholeness. The tale presents two lands divided by a Great River: the land of the senses (ordinary consciousness) and the land of the spirit (higher consciousness). The journey to unite these lands symbolizes the transformation of the human soul into a complete and free being.

The characters and elements in the story serve as alchemical symbols:

- **The Snake** represents the part of us willing to delve into the unconscious to retrieve hidden treasures.
- **The Prince and Lily** symbolize the seeking soul and pure spiritual forces, respectively.
- **The Ferryman** facilitates transitions between the realms.
- **The Temple** embodies wisdom, appearance, strength, and, ultimately, love.

The story illustrates a process of transformation involving separation, purification, and reunification. The Snake’s self-sacrifice mirrors the idea of dying to an old self to realize a greater unity, much like the death and resurrection in Christian theology.

### Rudolf Steiner’s Interpretation

Steiner spent years studying this tale, eventually declaring it a transformative text with the power to guide readers toward spiritual wholeness. He adapted the story into a mystery play, performed in his temple, the Goetheanum, in Switzerland. Steiner viewed the story as an allegory for bridging the inner and outer worlds, much as his Anthroposophy sought to harmonize science, spirituality, and society.

Steiner’s interpretation emphasized alchemical transformation, viewing the story’s elements as metaphors for the human soul’s evolution. His broader esoteric work, including his Anthroposophical Society, aimed to create a bridge between the material and spiritual realms, inspired by Goethe’s narrative.

### Conclusion

Steiner’s vision of unification, inspired by *The Green Snake and the Beautiful Lily*, offers profound insights into the journey toward spiritual integration. The story reminds us that transformation requires courage, sacrifice, and the awakening of hidden potentials within ourselves. It calls us to build bridges—within our own souls and across the divisions in our world.

May we find the strength to delve into the depths, embrace love as our guiding principle, and unite the disparate parts of ourselves and our society.

**Amen.**
