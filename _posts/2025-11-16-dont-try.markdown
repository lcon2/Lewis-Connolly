&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t work. And don’t try.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close your eyes.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something will arise; you won’t choose what that is. It just comes.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like breath.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems entirely random.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tonight, I’ve listened to “Jump in the Line” by Harry Belafonte an embarrassing number of times.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I find myself writing this. I’m not sure I could name the why. I have this website, and my decision to create it—whenever that was, over a decade ago—plays on my mind. I feel I should contribute something. Occasionally my wife tells me that someone’s someone reads it, and I think, *shit, I really should write more…*  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it’s not really a need; it’s more like, *fuck, people actually read this shit? Okay, I guess… okay, let’s go.*  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I don’t care.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean I don’t care as a compulsion.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is amazing the extent to which I am controlled, or directed, by something over which I have no control. For weeks I feel entirely content with my primary focus being some PC game, and then all of a sudden I’m like, *okay, time to write something.*  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel like I’m done with Christianity. That’s been on my mind a bit.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sense has arisen from exhaustion; it’s not a reasoned move, it’s emotive. I just have a sense that I’m done. Probably my intellectual curiosity has sustained my participation for a while now. And it’s still there. But I’m not convinced the myth does all that much for me anymore. Even as I write that, I’m not entirely convinced with myself—the myth is obviously doing a lot. But in some deeper way I’m not sure I know how to name, it feels redundant.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m exhausted by the insanity. I think in the face of such chaos some may lean in; I’ve spent a lot of time leaning in, and it has exhausted me.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think curiosity is the purpose. I have two daughters; I don’t want them to try. It’s my prayer for them. I want them to listen to what is inside them, to be receptive to whatever that current is. I won’t even talk about purpose, because I think that is a kind of subversion—*all I want is for you to find your purpose and follow that with all your passion*—fuck that. Find your passion today, in this moment. And tomorrow, find your passion then. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold petals in your mouth.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t try.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the Charles Bukowski thing—the poet—what’s written on his grave: “Don’t try.”  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I aspire after that mantra.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it arises today, in this moment, follow it. This is what it means to be you.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you not see it? I am a prophet of the new age.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one calling in the wilderness, calling you back to yourself.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are you going to do otherwise? There is nothing to do. I already know you’re tired. I think you should stop.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t think you should try. Breathe.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chill the fuck out.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You’re so after it. And given that there is really nothing to pursue—nothing at the end of the rainbow—you need to stop. You need to just breathe right here.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something may arise, but maybe not. Just sit with it. Days, months. Just stop.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing to find.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing at the center.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is nothing behind the veil.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so what… I am here. Present to the now. Breathing.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And something feels real. It’s a conversation, it’s a mountain, it’s a sip of cabernet sauvignon, it’s my daughter who finds me funny.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the fuck else? I am fucking funny.
