It would be funny to release an AI album. I've been listening to some AI songs on Spotify recently, such as Many Men by Shifty Brent, a soulful 60s reimagining of the 50 Cent rap song. And The Velvet Sundown, probably the most famous AI band, a soft-rock, indie-Americana project. It's a particularly good example because it really leans into the fantasy of it all. "Their" profile on Spotify even includes photographs of the "band," all of which are, of course, AI-generated. They (or he) have created a consistent sound; it would be easy to believe this is a real band with a backstory, a van. It just so happens that this plausible alternate history is purely the result of a few clever prompts given to an AI music generator.

Just to be clear, I have virtually no musical ability -- the height of my music career was being part of Mrs. Fenton's school choir. But I listen to my fair share of stuff.

Okay, so first I need a singer. I'll model him on me. We're stepping into the multiverse here: an alternative-history me, a folk-singer me with a spiritual bent. Open white shirt, some prayer beads, and we'll put him in a Scottish nature scene. Something like this...

Looks hilarious!

Okay, I'll need a stage name. I'll ask AI for some suggestions... something with a Scottish, folk-singer feel... Iain Wilder, Rowan North, Finlay Moor, Ciaran Vale, Jonah Stillwater. I'll go with Rowan North. That sounds right.

Okay, now for the lyrics. I'm going for something kind of Celtic-spirituality-esque. I like the work of George William Russell (1867-1935), the Irish writer, painter, and poet. I think I'll try an AI lyric prompt that draws upon one of his works -- Candle of Vision -- with its Irish nature, folklore, and theosophy vibes. (I'll put the AI-generated lyrics at the end of this article.)

To do this, I'm using the website Suno.com. I'm going to sing into a microphone now, so it has a sample of my voice and can do its magic.

And presto! Here it is. It doesn't sound much like me at all, but that is probably a good thing. I'm going to generate a few more -- maybe a little mini album.
