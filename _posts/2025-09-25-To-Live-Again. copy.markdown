&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last month I finished *The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August* by Catherine Webb. I really liked it. I don’t read much fiction anymore, but this is one of the best things I’ve read in a few years at least.  
I’m not really sure what I should say about it. If you think you might read it based on me saying I liked it, then I would stop reading this now and order the book, and that’s good enough for me.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My only real critique—and obviously I’m only critiquing because I really liked it, otherwise I wouldn’t care—is the mechanics of time travel. They sent me down a rabbit hole of thinking about time travel, so maybe this negative was kind of a positive. I enjoyed what it made me think about. And I kind of wonder if that might not be the definition of happiness: to do the things that put you into the states in which you wish to be (that goes for who you share space with too).  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole thing hinges on this idea that a select group of people are special, in that when they die, they are reborn into the exact circumstances of their first life, eventually remembering, after a few years, everything from their previous lives.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For good or ill, I’ve definitely had versions of this fantasy. I wake up in 2003 in my English boarding school, age 15, knowing everything I know now—what do I do? How would I live my life differently? This is probably why the book appealed to me so much; it plays into a recurring fantasy of mine.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1997 I asked my mum, if she could be anyone in the whole world, who would she want to be? She said herself. I clarified my question—she could be the smartest, the richest, the whatever-est in the whole world. But she insisted. She wanted to be herself. Within a year of that conversation, she died. I remember thinking at the time how foolish she was not to have taken my offer. She wanted to be someone who died.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would have made the same choice.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some found their own births interrupted; as such, they were not born in that timeline, and had to wait for the next. I feel this is stressed once or twice in the novel, and maybe I missed something, but I don’t get it—what difference does it make? They don’t exist.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I’m not wholly convinced the time travel stuff is logically consistent, though to be fair, maybe getting time travel logically consistent is virtually impossible.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I wrote a book for such a traveler, what should it include? Of course it brings to mind the Sports Almanac from *Back to the Future* (1985), but would that be enough? I would want stock charts, lottery numbers, even a cultural sensitivity guide.
