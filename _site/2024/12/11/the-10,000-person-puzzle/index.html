<p><em>Silo</em> (2023) is a great series; it is set in a seemingly post-apocalyptic world in which 10,000 people live in a ‘silo’ or underground vault. The silo is entirely self-sustaining, across its 144 floors everything is covered, from food to electricity production, to maintenance, medical care, and security, to anything else you can think of, anything which would be necessary to keep the population self-sustained. Through carefully monitoring and sanctioning of childbearing this 10,000-population number is kept static.</p>

<p>This got me thinking about how difficult it would be to maintain a stable population within a closed system. As we can see from population statistics, childbearing from one generation to the next is not at all stable. In the United States, women are having on average 1.62 children; this number has halved since the early 1960s. The replacement rate is 2.1; that is the number to replace the father and the mother, with the .1 accounting for child mortality, women who cannot reproduce, or women who die before they do so. As such, if a woman has fewer than 2.1 children, they are contributing to population decline.</p>

<p>If we assume life expectancy is 77 (I’m not sure if in an underground vault in which everyone’s needs are accommodated for, we should assume a lower or higher life expectancy than the current national average). I’m also assuming no individual autonomy; this would all have to be managed planned-economy style. I’m also assuming that all childbearing is done by women aged 20 to 30—if you’re going to manage this directly, it’s probably best to target the optimal fertility window.</p>

<p>So, the calculation would be 10,000 / 2 = 5000 women. 5000 women / 77 ≈ 65 women per age group. 65 * the 10 optimal fertility years = 650 women at any given time aimiing to have their approximate 2.1 children within their fertility window. In such a limited system, maintaining a stable population is not as simple as meeting replacement rates, however. Genetic variability must also be carefully managed to avoid inbreeding and ensure long-term viability. Additionally, a static system of this size would be highly susceptible to the effects of sudden mortality events, such as disease or disasters. These risks make it imperative to regularly monitor and modulate the population at a granular level.</p>

<p>This would be a good idea for a computer game. Many games are based on exploration, base building, and resource exploitation, but what about a game in which all of that is already done, and the objective is just to maintain the population, optimize for genetic traits, educate and deploy individuals to work within a closed system of this kind.</p>

<p><strong>Vaultborne: A Matchmaker’s Dilemma</strong><br />
In <em>Vaultborne</em>, you take on the role of population manager for an isolated colony of 10,000 individuals living in a self-contained underground vault. Built to preserve humanity after a global catastrophe, the vault is a sealed, self-sustaining ecosystem where every resource and individual must be carefully managed to ensure survival.</p>

<p>Through strategic matchmaking, education programs, and job allocation, you must maintain genetic diversity, balance labor needs, and preserve the vault’s long-term viability. The simulation evolves dynamically, presenting challenges like resource scarcity, genetic drift, and cultural conflicts, ensuring every decision has far-reaching consequences.</p>
