<h2 id="profile">Profile</h2>

<p>My name is <strong>Lewis A. Connolly</strong>. I was born in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1988.</p>

<p>As a child, I moved a lot. I grew up in Scotland, Texas, and England.</p>

<p>I have had this website for over ten years, and in that time, my views have changed.</p>

<p>There is a lot on here about religion. While I find religion interesting, I do not have a religious disposition.</p>

<p>I started this website in 2015 when I was in the process of leaving the Church of England (where I was a priest) and joining the Unitarian Church to become a minister.</p>

<p>I was a Unitarian minister for five years, primarily serving at the Ipswich Unitarian Meeting House in Suffolk, England.</p>

<p>I subsequently moved to the United States.</p>

<p>I’m married. My wife, <a href="https://www.catconnolly.com/">Catherine Connolly</a>, was in the process of becoming a priest while I was in the process of leaving the priesthood. She is now an Episcopalian priest here in the United States.</p>

<p>We have kids, and I now spend most of my time running around after them.</p>
