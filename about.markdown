## Profile

My name is **Lewis A. Connolly**. I was born in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1988.

As a child, I moved a lot. I grew up in Scotland, Texas, and England.

I have had this website for over ten years, and in that time, my views have changed.

There is a lot on here about religion. While I find religion interesting, I do not have a religious disposition.

I started this website in 2015 when I was in the process of leaving the Church of England (where I was a priest) and joining the Unitarian Church to become a minister.

I was a Unitarian minister for five years, primarily serving at the Ipswich Unitarian Meeting House in Suffolk, England.

I subsequently moved to the United States.

I’m married. My wife, [Catherine Connolly](https://www.catconnolly.com/), was in the process of becoming a priest while I was in the process of leaving the priesthood. She is now an Episcopalian priest here in the United States.

We have kids, and I now spend most of my time running around after them.
