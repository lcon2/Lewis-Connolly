  This paper explores how time functions in Marcel Proust’s À la recherche du temps perdu through the philosophical lenses of Henri Bergson and Carl Jung. Focusing on Proust’s “privileged moments” of memory and perception, it argues that Bergsonian duration and Jungian concepts of synchronicity and the timeless unconscious offer a powerful framework for understanding Proustian temporality. In doing so, the essay reveals a shared challenge to linear, mechanistic time and proposes an alternative, more humane vision of lived experience.

## Introduction
À la recherche du temps perdu (In Search of Lost Time) by Marcel Proust is a bewilderingly rich text, covering a wide range of subjects – love, death, war, history, homosexuality, literary style, sleep, psychology, memory, and time – across a seven-volume magnum opus longer than any other in the Western literary canon. Time itself is the author’s primary issue of concern: all-pervasive time that is elastic, elusive, and acts much like a villain, destroying all people, places, and things in its wake. This dissertation will begin with a literature review exploring what key literary critics have said regarding Proust’s privileged moments, pertaining particularly to the function of time. Following this, in the section “Preliminary Context”, I will draw out some themes from the literary review and highlight the essay’s principal Jungian area of enquiry which has gone unexplored. Subsequently, the paper will examine Proust’s influences, particularly pertaining to Proustian temporality as it finds expression in the novel. The review will finally focus upon Henri Bergson’s philosophy of temporality as a key Proustian influence in order to define and characterise the nature of Proustian temporality. This essay also touches on the difficulties of establishing authorial intent and the complexities surrounding drawing conclusions about an author from their writing, which is itself a form of art and creative exploration. Following the literature review, the paper will outline Jungian temporality and explore the theory of synchronicity, which moves us towards a metaphysical understanding of space and time, before contrasting it with Proustian temporality, as informed ostensibly by Bergson. The conjunction and analogous nature of their theories can elucidate a close reading of Proust’s composition of time. Then, the lattermost section of this paper will selectively explore the role of time in Proust’s novel, focusing in on a few key Proustian privileged moments – the madeleine in particular – through both a Bergsonian and a Jungian lens. In considering these Proustian moments, these artistic compositions of time and their effect upon the reader, we can recognise the challenge the text offers its readers: bringing into sharp contrast the dehumanising working model of time in the modern world – how we are governed by it, how we think about it, how we build our lives around it – and an alternative vision: a vision that courageously moves us towards life and the artistic truth of things.

## Literature Review
The critical tradition of writing on Proust has never let up since the publication of À la recherche in the early twentieth century, carrying on until now. Given the text’s inexhaustible complexity, a great deal can be and has been written on it. Much attention falls upon the now-established trope, the “Proustian moment”, also referred to as the “madeleine moment” (the primary example in the text) or “privileged moments.” These moments invariably bring into the discussion pertinent issues concerning this paper: issues concerning temporality and linearity, along with autobiographical memory and involuntary memory. What follows is a cursory exploration of that critical literature, calling attention to notable literary critics and focusing on issues pertinent to the scope of this paper, most critically, as we examine the presentation and experience of time – that of temporality.

Theodor Adorno of the Frankfurt School, in his essay “Short Commentaries on Proust,” focuses less on the overarching themes of À la recherche as a whole and more on particular fragments. In fact, Adorno asserts that to subject the text as a whole to grand overarching untruths from above does the text itself a disservice, undermining Proust’s very purposes. However, the great theme of the text, for Adorno, is paradoxically presented as duration – the durée – to attend to, to rescue the transient: a process concentrated in the particulars of countless moments which manifest ultimately as an “invisible unity in the midst of dispersion… evident only to the divine observer” (Adorno, 2019, p. 180). Adorno draws a parallel between Proust’s work and that of Henri Bergson, particularly Bergson’s ideas concerning the role of intuition as presented in An Introduction to Metaphysics. He states that the conjunction of two elements runs through À la recherche – namely intuition and French rationality – making up the Proustian atmosphere. “Bergson’s allergic reaction to ready-made thought, the pre-given and established cliché” (Adorno, 2019, p. 180) is, according to Adorno, reflected in Proust’s prose. In the final section of the essay, Adorno explains that Proust writes from a belief that one can no longer speak directly of ultimate things because the Enlightenment has invalidated such vocabulary. “The important word that calls them by name weakens them” (Adorno, 2019, p. 186). Adorno’s view is that Proust’s spirit was wholly metaphysical, but in the early 20th century this use of vocabulary was rendered unsuitable; this sets up a tension which runs through the text. Rarely does Proust make any explicitly metaphysical statements. But Adorno highlights one particular exception from volume five, “The Captive”: “…the idea that Bergotte was not wholly and permanently dead is by no means improbable” (Proust, 1929b, p. 115). Adorno explains that this statement suggests that for Proust, the order of nature is not the ultimate order. But though this statement is made dismissing the finality of death, it comes to us not as a promise or proof but in a transient fashion, for it is communicated through the medium of art, which comes to us as “the last metaphors for revelation in the authentic language” (Adorno, 2019, p. 187).

The political theorist Hannah Arendt, in her short essay “No Longer and Not Yet” (2007), talks about the context following WWI – namely the gulf which opened in literature, the so-called “Lost Generation.” In response, there were those who harkened back, and those who imagined forward. As per the title of her essay, Proust represents the “No Longer,” whereas Franz Kafka the “Not Yet.” (Arendt, 2007, p. 122).

The playwright Samuel Beckett’s often abstruse Schopenhauerian essay “Proust” (1999) does explore issues of temporality, albeit for his own ends, given that similar themes of temporality informed his later work. He notes that the only frame of reference deemed to have reality and significance for À la recherche’s narrator is “the world of our own latent consciousness” (Beckett, 1999, p. 13). This observation serves Beckett’s principal assertion in his essay, that “We cannot know and we cannot be known” (Beckett, 1999, p. 66). In this respect, Proustian temporality, as Beckett frames it, is wholly subjective; there is a clear contention between one’s subjectively experienced perception of time and any illusive objectivity that may lie beyond the narrator. Beckett argues that people are trapped by their pasts; their pasts have cultivated habit and familiarity. The true essence of reality is lost in this cloud of conventionality. Our ongoing creation of the world becomes habitual. Only in times of great change or calamity are we awakened to the true reality of things. The narrator, Beckett recognises, is seeking to shock us into perceiving reality afresh, inviting us to become artists of our own world. Beckett differentiates between two types of memory: “voluntary” memory, which is the memory of habit, and “involuntary” memory which breaks habit. “Involuntary memory is an unruly magician and will not be importuned… It chooses its own time and place for the performance of its miracle” (Beckett, 1999, p. 34). For Beckett, involuntary memory is the principal theme to À la recherche. The most cited involuntary memory incident in Swann’s Way occurs when the protagonist eats a piece of madeleine, which brings back memories of his aunt Léonie in Combray. This, for Beckett, represents the narrator’s “victory over time” (Beckett, 1999, p. 69), and thus his negation of death. “Time is not recovered, it is obliterated” (Beckett, 1999, p. 75). For Beckett, in these moments imagination triumphs over time.

The cultural critic Walter Benjamin, Proust’s first great translator, in his essay “The Image of Proust” explores the role memory plays in À la recherche – Proust’s art of remembering in his dark cork-lined room, which constitutes not the endless unfolding of banality, as it may at first appear, but his ultimate pursuit of happiness. A pursuit which produces his seven volumes: his “honeycombs of memory… a house for a swarm of his thoughts” (Benjamin, 2007, p. 203). According to Benjamin, this frenzied quest for happiness underlies Proust’s principal effort – his ceaseless will to happiness – an intent which Benjamin thinks readers and critics alike often overlook. A will to happiness which Proust explores in his poetics as “the eternal restoration of the original, the first happiness” (Benjamin, 2007, p. 204). This allows Proust to make even seemingly pointless stories interesting, acting as they do as triggers to unlock Proust’s imagined past. Benjamin states that for Proust, any banal moment may reveal similarities between what is perceived in his wakeful state and impressions from his dream world.
