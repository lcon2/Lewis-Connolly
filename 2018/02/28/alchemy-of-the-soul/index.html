<p>I’ll begin this morning by defining what Alchemy is. Alchemy was the ancient practice of combining matter, physical stuff, together, in such a way that you produce something with supernatural power. It was the art of transformation. You can think of the caterpillar – it goes into its cocoon, and therein undergoes a complete transformation. It does not merely modify, or gain extra components, but its whole form breaks down and is reconstituted into the butterfly. So in Alchemy, the substances used are broken down into a state of chaos, from which a miraculous physical substance emerges which can produce magical results. Sometimes these magical results in alchemical books are defined, and sometimes, probably most of the time, it is left far more elusive. When they are defined, that’s where we get the famous examples like the philosopher’s stone, capable of turning any ‘base metal’ into a so-called ‘noble metal,’ such as gold. Or, the elixir of life, or elixir of immortality, which grants eternal life or eternal youth.</p>

<p>In my short story, I painted a picture of an old man who had devoted his life to this task, trying to evoke the tragic nature of this pursuit. Countless decades devoted to an art with an impossible end. The historical figure who comes to mind is the proto-Unitarian, Isaac Newton. Yes, he laid the foundation of modern physics, and invented calculus. Yes, he proved categorically that the planets revolved around the sun. Yes, he discovered the laws of motion and gravity. But to him, these were all side projects. He was first and foremost an alchemist – the most famous alchemist to ever live. It’s an odd thing to reconcile, that the greatest scientist ever would devote most of his energy to a pseudoscientific art. We may be baffled today, but those around him then in the 17th Century who knew he toiled at this illegal art were equally baffled. I gave you that quote on your order of service from Humphrey Newton (of no relation), his lab assistant, who said, “What his aim might be, I was not able to penetrate into, but his pains, his diligence at these times, made me think he aimed at something beyond the reach of human art and industry.”</p>

<p>We as human beings have a tendency towards infusing matter (things) with subjective significance. So, it’s not just wood, it’s a chair. It’s not just a chair, it’s my grandmother’s chair, and if you spill wine on it I will be deeply hurt. It’s not just metal. It’s a ring. It’s my ring. It’s the ring that signifies I am married to this person, and marriage entails: long list of cultural norms… There’s a tendency then for human beings to take the deepest longing of ourselves and in some way project them out onto the world around us.</p>

<p>In the crap it will be found. And so, within the flame of the Alchemist, we bubble into an impure broth. We have our dark nights of the soul, but in time we transform into a precious substance. A precious soul comes, is brought forth. We are subject to the wrath of God, the calamities of this world, and in turn, we are moulded into something still greater. And so, the drive within us towards spiritual depth is satisfied a little more. We move a step closer within our interior world to that pearl of great price, that philosopher’s stone, that elixir of immortality.</p>

<p><strong>Amen.</strong></p>
